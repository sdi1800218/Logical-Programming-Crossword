    % 1. MODELING/TEMPLATING:
    %   v Make Boxes
    %   - Make Slots
    %   ? Play with words ?

    % a. get dimnsion from global state
    dimension(N),

    % b. Set N+1 as the limit for unification purposes
    AnotherN is N+1,

    % c. Get the box/3 triples and enumerate them
    get_boxes(AnotherN, Boxes),
    enum_boxes(Boxes, EnumBoxes),

    % d. Get Slots and enumerate them
    get_slots(AnotherN, Slots).
    %enum_slots(Slots, EnumSlots).

    % 3. Solve

    % 4. Print
