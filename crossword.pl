/*
We will attempt to model the solution of the problem, based on the reasearch
found in the below two papers that build one on top of the other.

    2.

:- compile(input/cross01).

% We are given as facts:
%   1. dimension(N).
%   2. black(X, Y) multiple pairs,
%                   X == Row, Y == Column
%   3. words(List).

/*
- (each word slot is uniquely identiÔ¨Åed, but mutual constraints among words are maintained with variable sharing
*/
crosssword(Solution) :-

    % 1. Make template NxN matrix with black contrictions


    % 2. Get available horizontal targets of the form ((), Length)

    % 3. Solve

    % 4. Print
